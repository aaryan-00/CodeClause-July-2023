# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project
# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of different machine learning models using customer-level data. The dataset used for analysis contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders over a period of two days in September 2013. Out of a total of 284,807 transactions, 492 were fraudulent, making the dataset highly imbalanced.

## Business Problem Overview

For many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. However, credit card fraud poses a significant threat to this goal, resulting in substantial financial losses, trust issues, and credibility concerns for both banks and customers.

To combat this problem, machine learning is becoming a necessity in the banking industry for implementing proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms. Machine learning models can help reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks, fees, and denials of legitimate transactions.

## Understanding and Defining Fraud

Credit card fraud involves any dishonest act or behavior to obtain financial gain without proper authorization from the account holder. It can be carried out through skimming (duplicating information from the magnetic strip of the card), manipulation/alteration of genuine cards, creation of counterfeit cards, stealing/loss of credit cards, and fraudulent telemarketing.

## Data Dictionary

The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and contains the following features:

- `Time`: The seconds elapsed between the first transaction and subsequent transactions.
- `Amount`: The transaction amount.
- `V1, V2, ..., V28`: Principal components obtained using PCA (for confidentiality).
- `Class`: The class label, with 1 representing fraudulent transactions and 0 for non-fraudulent transactions.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Conduct exploratory data analysis and handle any missing or skewed data. Address the issue of imbalanced data.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Select relevant features, scale numerical features, and encode categorical variables, if any.

3. **Model Development**: Train different machine learning models to predict credit card fraud.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using appropriate performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

5. **Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Choose the best-performing model and fine-tune its hyperparameters for optimal results.

6. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and discuss potential areas of improvement for future iterations.
